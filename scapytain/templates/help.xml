            <h1>Help on Scapytain</h1>

            <h2>What is Scapytain</h2>

            <p>
	Scapytain is a web application that
	can help to manage test campaigns using Scapy snippets.
            </p>

            <h2>Scapytain framework</h2>

            <p>
        Scapytain offers 4 spaces: tests, test plans, test means and campaigns .
            </p>
            <h3>Tests</h3>

            <p>
	The test space holds tests, organized by test groups.
	Each version of the test code is remembered.
	Tests may have dependencies on other tests.
            </p>

            <h3>Test Plans</h3>

            <p>
	Each test plan is a collection of objectives, grouped by sections. 
            </p>

            <h3>Test means</h3>

            <p>
	A test mean is a description of a set of physical resources, associated with some initialization code.
	This can be used if, for intance, an equipment is present with IP 10.0.0.30 on a bench and 172.16.1.30 on another,
	to create tests independant from this and use the value provided by the test mean initialization code.
            </p>


            <h3>Campaigns</h3>

            <p>
	A campaign gathers a set of test plans. A campaign is launched by creating a campaign run. A campaign run
	contains all the tests needed to check their objectives, plus dependency tests.
	A campaign can have a default test mean. Each campaign run can change this default.
